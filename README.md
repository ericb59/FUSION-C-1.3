# FUSION-C-1.3 BETA
 Fusion-C Library and SDK for MSX Computers 
 
 
 PLEASE NOTE : THIS VERSION IS A BETA VERSION, and was abandonned.
The new FUSION-C 2.0 is based on this 1.3 version, and will come to life as soon as possible.

 
 
 What are the promises of FUSION-C 1.3!
More useful functions for games.
The graphics functions (especially for MSX2) are much faster than before.
The final generated code is smaller than before.

An SDK integrating openMSX, to quickly test your code on different configurations. The ability to override the default compilation directives, without having to modify the compilation script.
And more ...

 What I need to do : 
- Checking Examples, because some code has changed
- Finishing / Reworking some chapters of the manual
- Verifying compil.bat compilation script (Still not tested)
- some debuging

Release Notes for openMSX Catapult for openMSX 16.0 (2020-08-25)
================================================================

Catapult release to match openMSX 16.0.

This release we again didn't change much, so here is the full list:
- Fix hidden openMSX window when launching from Catapult
- Migrated build to Python 3
- Migrated to wxWidgets 3.0
- Make supported extensions consistent with openMSX command line
- Replaced Accuracy control with VSync button
- Replaced Min and Max Frameskip controls with fast forward speed controls
- Added button to enable full speed when loading ("Fast Load")

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly. Use the spacebar to
  deselect extensions! CTRL-click also works.
- not feature complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert
  to the openMSX console (press F10/Cmd+L) or the OSD menu (MENU key/Cmd+O)

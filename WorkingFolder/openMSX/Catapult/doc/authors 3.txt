Historical note:

openMSX Catapult was originally developed by Manuel Bilderbeek in Qt 3 (for
Linux), with the help of Michael Goettsche. Soon Herman Oudejans made a Windows
version in Visual Studio with MFC. However, we wanted to make a common program
that is portable to different operating systems, so we started a total rewrite
based on wxWidgets and added it as a subproject to openMSX CVS. This is the
result!

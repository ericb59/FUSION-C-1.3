Multipaint readme.txt


1. prefs.txt location

    Notice the prefs.txt is now in the /data/ folder of the Multipaint application folders.
    This folder also contains many other files such as the templates needed for exporting the target platform files.

    With mac, you may need to "Show Package Contents" instead of running the app and look for Java/data/


2. Multipaint manual

    I have stopped distributing the multipaint.pdf manual with the zip.

    Please look at multipaint.kameli.net for quick reference.

    The comprehensive document is online at:

    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ewxr9MNFbn4TfRWOWPXsacvIiR3fL6goXi9ry60mBNA/edit?usp=sharing

    There you can also export a pdf if needed.

Bitbuster v1.2 - (c) 2002-2003  Team Bomba
------------------------------------------


Bitbuster is a new set of (de)compression-tools for MSX and PC. It was created because I was getting frustrated by POPCOM; it made crash Bombaman. That's why Bitbuster was created.


Bitbuster vs POPCOM
-------------------
Bitbuster looks a lot like POPCOM, they both use a similar compression scheme. The compression ratio is pretty much the same, sometimes bitbuster is better than popcom and vice versa. Here's a little comparison (files mostly taken from Bombaman). The lengths stated for POPCOM are the lengths of the compressed data without decompression code.

How to use Bitbuster packer
--------------------------
To compress a file, simply type the following on the commandline:
pack <sourcefile> [sourcefile1] ...
This will compress all specified files. You can also use wildcards in filenames. The new files will get the extension .pck. 


How to use Bitbuster depacker (executables)
-----------------------------
To decompress a file (on PC), simple type the following on the commandline:
depack <sourcefile> <destfile>
This will decrunch sourcefile and write the original data to destfile.


Stuff to do
-----------
-file i/o error handling
-optimize for speed!
-msx-version of packer, anyone?

# graphxconv
 Graphx Converter v0.5 is a tool for converting BMP images with a size of 256 x 192 pixels to a fixed palette of 16 colors, such as the MSX Screen 2 mode, using the CIEDE2000 conversion algorithm.

The tool converts the source image and saves the new image in MSX format for Mode 2. The conversion may take a few tens of seconds, depending on the power of your computer.

graphxconv: launches on the command line. A graphical interface is then available to view the conversion, and compare this conversion with new conversion parameters or new color palettes.
